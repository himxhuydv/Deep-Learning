# Forward propagation
this is the core thing that come's inside of the deep learning that thing is generally stand as the data is input then goes through the multiple layer and done some operation.
*So that input goes from every layer's*
**Input goes with every neural network and each neuron do some adding of bias,weighted sum will be added and then they will goes through the activation point gives output**
Here is the step by step   
1.Input Layer's
2.Hidden Layer's 
3.Output Layer's
**Input Layer**:this layer's input the data,multiple layer takes the input parallel.
**Hidden Layer**:this data comes from input and then do mathsmatical operation add bias and added weighted pass through activation function and then goes to the next part
**Output Layer** : this layer basically do the output or the prediction 

### This process is a important thing that comes before backward propagation.
